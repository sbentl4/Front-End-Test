For our developer test, we're asking that you code up an interior page based on one of our homepage designs (see link below). The header and footer from the homepage design should be included, and the main portion of the page should include colors, fonts and an overall aesthetic that coordinates with the look and feel established in the homepage design.

The interior should be a news article page (lorem ipsum) with the following elements:

    Interior version of header (including nav, search and logo)
    //Headline
    ?Subhead
    //Date
    //Feature Photo
    //Photo Caption
    //Pull Quote
    //Ordered List
    //Unordered List
    //Embedded YouTube video

    //Left Rail Nav with a secondary level sample nav expanded

    /Links to three related articles
    /Gray footer bar w/ placeholder # links


Please deliver back to us a fully tested and responsive page. [Browsers: Edge, IE 11 & 10, latest Chrome and Firefox for both PC and Mac, latest Safari for Mac.] Please send a front-end link for review, along with final .html and .css files.
